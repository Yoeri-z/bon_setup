A collection of utilities is use in my projects.

# Contents

This package contains the following:

- All the contents of the bon_setup package (dependency injection, logging utilities, functional result pattern)
- The `Provider`, `ChangeNotifierProvider` and `ProxyProvider` widgets from `provider`
- A `Prop` class to wrap values that are to be displayed on ui
- A `Guard` and `MultiGuard` widget to guard against invalid `Prop`s being displayed.
- A `GuardedProvider` which is a `ChangeNotifierProvider` and `MultiGuard` in one widget.
